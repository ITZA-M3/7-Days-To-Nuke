Interactions w/ objects: 
Inspect? - Y/N
There is a weird carving on the wall. You -Ignore/Look Closer-
  @You ignore the carving and continue on with you trek towards wherever you are going.
  @Looking closer, it shows a heart with the initials M + C inside.
There’s a clogged toilet in the stall next to the one you just finished cleaning, you -unclog/leave alone-
  @Unclogging the toilet is unpleasant, but you did it anyways. However, after you unclog the toilet, you see a glint in the toilet bowl. You -grab it/flush-
    $Curious, you grab the object. Upon closer inspection, it just seems to be poop. Turns out, it was just the light reflecting off the surface of the water. You immediately drop it back into the toilet bowl. You should probably go wash your hands now.
    $You flush the object without a second thought, reverting it back to its original state.
  @You leave the stall, knowing that you are going to have to come back to it eventually.
You pass by the Crew quarters and see a bottle of what seems to be whiskey. You -leave it alone/pick it up-
  @You continue walking. But you remain forever curious about the whiskey.
  @You pick up the bottle, cautiously taking a whiff. It smells quite…. Different than what you’re used to. You -put down the bottle and leave/take a swig anyways-
    $You carefully put down the ‘whiskey’ to where it was originally and leave.
    $You gag, realizing the ‘whiskey’ was actually urine. Luckily, you decided to bring some water with you.
You see a random lamp sitting in the corner of the the room. You -poke it/turn it on-
  @You poke the lamp and it just falls. Shattering the bulb inside. It is also now blocking the way. You decide to -leave it/bring it back upright-
    $You carefully step over the lamp, ignoring the consequences to come. After a few steps you hear a crash. You turn around and a guard has fallen. You -help guard(acquires key card)/stare-
      %You help the guard while quickly grabbing the key card. You don’t know what you were thinking but it just happened. *Acquired Key Card!* The guard thanks you and picks up the lamp so no one else falls like he did. He then goes on to doing what he was doing before. (one way of getting key card)
      %You stare at the fallen soldier, wondering how he didn’t see the lamp lying there. You shrug it off and let the guard get up on his own.
   $You lean the lamp against the wall as a guard rushes pass you and accidently hits your shoulder. You almost fall back from the impact, but you manage to stay standing. He apologizes as he continues running down the hall.
  @You turn on the lamp and immediately, someone comes up from behind you and turns it off saying ‘Are you an idiot? Why would you turn on a lamp when there’s already light from the ceiling? You’re wasting electricity!’ You shrug and go on your day
